p --\textgreater{} a

support = 4/5 = 0.8 confidence = 4/5 = 0.8

p --\textgreater{} a is a strong association rule

a --\textgreater{} p should be a strong association rule too because

support = 4/5 and a appears in 4/5 with confidence = 4/4 = 1.0

\section{(25 points) Basics of
Patterns}\label{points-basics-of-patterns}

\subsection{(a) (5 points) Given a transaction database T DB, we
partition it into two parts, T DB1 and T DB2. If an itemset X is
frequent in both T DB1 and T DB2 with respect to a minimum (relative)
support threshold s, is it possible for X to be frequent in original T
DB?
Why?}\label{a-5-points-given-a-transaction-database-t-db-we-partition-it-into-two-parts-t-db1-and-t-db2.-if-an-itemset-x-is-frequent-in-both-t-db1-and-t-db2-with-respect-to-a-minimum-relative-support-threshold-s-is-it-possible-for-x-to-be-frequent-in-original-t-db-why}

suppose you had two partitions of TDB and minsupport is 0.5

TDB1 = 2 transactions only and the itemset X appears in both
transactions, the frequency is 1

TDB2 = 100 transactions, and X occurs in 51 of them, the frequency =
0.51

so combined TDB has 102 transactions, 52 of then contain X the frequency
should be 0.519

so TDB is frequent in the original TDB, this is because TDB is a
combination of TDB1 and TDB2, the frequency should stay the same if not
increase after combining partitions.

\subsection{(b) (10 points) Suppose we have a T DB1 with the following
transactions: T1 = \{a10, a11, . . . , a20\}, T2 = \{a1, a2, . . . ,
a20\}, T3 = \{a1, a2, . . . ,
a25\}}\label{b-10-points-suppose-we-have-a-t-db1-with-the-following-transactions-t1-a10-a11-.-.-.-a20-t2-a1-a2-.-.-.-a20-t3-a1-a2-.-.-.-a25}

\subsubsection{(i) (3 points) For T DB1, how many max pattern(s) do we
have and what is(are) it(they) if minimum (absolute) support is
1?}\label{i-3-points-for-t-db1-how-many-max-patterns-do-we-have-and-what-isare-itthey-if-minimum-absolute-support-is-1}

T1 = \{a10, a11, \ldots, a20\} 11 items

T2 = \{a1, \ldots, a20\} 20 items

T3 = \{a1, \ldots, a25\} 25 items

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  min supp = 1
\end{enumerate}

we want any item that appears in at least 1 transaction

Every item from a1 to a25 appears in at least 1 transaction

Largest transaction = T3 = 25 items

1 max pattern

\{a1, \ldots, a25\}

\subsubsection{(ii) (3 points) For T DB1, how many max pattern(s) do we
have and what is(are) it(they) if minimum (absolute) support is
2?}\label{ii-3-points-for-t-db1-how-many-max-patterns-do-we-have-and-what-isare-itthey-if-minimum-absolute-support-is-2}

a1--a9 2 times

a10--a20 3 times

a21--a25 1 time

So frequent items = a1--a20

T2: \{a1--a20\} T3: \{a1--a25\} â†’ contains \{a1--a20\} but also some
infrequent items T1: \{a10--a20\}

max pattern with only frequent items = \{a1--a20\}

\subsubsection{(iii) (4 points) For T DB1, how many max pattern(s) do we
have and what is(are) it(they) if minimum (absolute) support is
3?}\label{iii-4-points-for-t-db1-how-many-max-patterns-do-we-have-and-what-isare-itthey-if-minimum-absolute-support-is-3}

the items have to appear in at least 3 transactions

a10--a20 is the largest itemset that appears in T1, T2, T3

1 max pattern

\{a10, \ldots, a20\}

\subsection{(c) (10 points) Suppose we have a T DB2 with the following
transactions: T4 = \{a1, a2, . . . , a10\}, T5 = \{a20, a21, . . . ,
a25\}, T6 = \{a1, a2, . . . ,
a25\}}\label{c-10-points-suppose-we-have-a-t-db2-with-the-following-transactions-t4-a1-a2-.-.-.-a10-t5-a20-a21-.-.-.-a25-t6-a1-a2-.-.-.-a25}

\subsubsection{(i) (3 points) For T DB2, how many max pattern(s) do we
have and what is(are) it(they) if minimum (absolute) support is
2?}\label{i-3-points-for-t-db2-how-many-max-patterns-do-we-have-and-what-isare-itthey-if-minimum-absolute-support-is-2}

Let's check frequency of items:

a1--a10 2 times

a11--a19 1 time

a20--a25 2 times

then frequent items \{a1--a10, a20--a25\}

max combinations

T4 \{a1--a10\} T5 \{a20--a25\} T6 all of them

so there are 2 max patterns that appear in 2 ore more transactions

\{a1--a10\}

\{a20--a25\}

\subsubsection{(ii)(3 points) For T DB2, how many closed pattern(s) do
we have and what is(are) it(they) if minimum (absolute) support is
1?}\label{ii3-points-for-t-db2-how-many-closed-patterns-do-we-have-and-what-isare-itthey-if-minimum-absolute-support-is-1}

we need the frequent patterns that are not a subset of any other
patterns

\{a1--a10\} 2

\{a20--a25\} 2

\{a1--a25\} 1

3 closed patterns

\subsubsection{(iii)(4 points) For T DB2, how many closed pattern(s) do
we have and what is(are) it(they) if minimum (absolute)
support}\label{iii4-points-for-t-db2-how-many-closed-patterns-do-we-have-and-what-isare-itthey-if-minimum-absolute-support}

a1--a10, a20--a25 are frequent and are the largest versions of their
patterns

2 closed patterns

\{a1--a10\}, \{a20--a25\}

\section{3. (25 points) Constraint-Based Pattern
Mining.}\label{points-constraint-based-pattern-mining.}

\#\#(a) (10 points) Given a collection of constraints (based on the
Product table), identify their types (monotone, anti-monotone, data
anti-monotone, succinct, convertible). If multiple types coexist in the
following constraints, please list them all.

Item Price Profit A 10 4 B 16 8 C 46 20 D 40 0 E 37 12 F 30 -10 G 45 -5

\subsubsection{i. (3 points) Total price of all purchased items is less
than
\$250.}\label{i.-3-points-total-price-of-all-purchased-items-is-less-than-250.}

This is anti montone because any larger sets of a set that violates this
will also violate the constraint

this is also convertible anti monotone if we rank items \#\#\# ii. (3
points) Total price of all purchased items is at least \$200.

monotone because any larger set will also satisfy the constraint

this is also convertible monotone for the same condition as i

\subsubsection{iii. (4 points) The minimal price of the purchased item
is less than
\$50.}\label{iii.-4-points-the-minimal-price-of-the-purchased-item-is-less-than-50.}

this is data anti-monotone because adding more items will only increase
the minimum

its anti monotone too because any superset wont satisfy either

this is convertible-antimonotone for the same condition as i

\subsection{(b) (10 points) Constraints are important pieces of
information that may speed up frequent itemset
mining.}\label{b-10-points-constraints-are-important-pieces-of-information-that-may-speed-up-frequent-itemset-mining.}

\subsubsection{i. (3 points) What is a convertible
constraint?}\label{i.-3-points-what-is-a-convertible-constraint}

if we can order our items properly, then we can convert a monotonic or
anti monotonic constraint into its counter part.

\subsubsection{ii. (3 points) Give an example of a convertible
constraint and explain how it can be pushed deep into the frequent
itemset mining process to speed up
mining.}\label{ii.-3-points-give-an-example-of-a-convertible-constraint-and-explain-how-it-can-be-pushed-deep-into-the-frequent-itemset-mining-process-to-speed-up-mining.}

if we say something like the average price of the itemset is at least
100 dollars

this is convertible monotone because if we sort items by increasing
price and prune data with lower prices, we can say that

once the itemset hits greater than 100 on average, any addition will
satisfy the constraint too

\subsubsection{iii. (4 points) Can your above constraint be pushed deep
into the mining using the Apriori algorithm or it is confined to the
pattern growth process (such as FP-Growth)? Briefly present your
reasoning.}\label{iii.-4-points-can-your-above-constraint-be-pushed-deep-into-the-mining-using-the-apriori-algorithm-or-it-is-confined-to-the-pattern-growth-process-such-as-fp-growth-briefly-present-your-reasoning.}

if we were to add this constraint into apriori, we'd have to make the
check everytime we generate candidates, but if we did it in FPGrowth,
we'd need to only make one pruning round to clear out all items that
would not contribute to an average of 100 or greater

so this would be better imlpemented in FP-growth

\subsection{(c) (5 points) Let A be an itemset (the pattern we are
considering) and V be a fixed bigger itemset. Is A âŠ† V anti-monotone? If
true, please explain the reason. Otherwise, please provide
counterexample.}\label{c-5-points-let-a-be-an-itemset-the-pattern-we-are-considering-and-v-be-a-fixed-bigger-itemset.-is-a-v-anti-monotone-if-true-please-explain-the-reason.-otherwise-please-provide-counterexample.}

this is anti-monotone because for A to be a subset of V, all items of A
need to be in V, if this isnt the case, and we add items to A (make a
superset), that previous item that violated the constraint still exists
in A, Thus the constraint is still violated.

\section{(25 points) Null Invariance}\label{points-null-invariance}

\subsection{(a) (10 points) Suppose the following table shows two
transaction data sets, S1 and S2, with the following count distributions
after mining frequent 2-itemsets, where mc means that the transaction
contains muffin but not
cheese.}\label{a-10-points-suppose-the-following-table-shows-two-transaction-data-sets-s1-and-s2-with-the-following-count-distributions-after-mining-frequent-2-itemsets-where-mc-means-that-the-transaction-contains-muffin-but-not-cheese.}

Data Set mc mc mc mc S1 900 100 100 900 S2 100 900 1,000 100,000

\subsubsection{i. (5 points) For each data set S1 and S2, compute
support, confidence and lift for the following
rules:}\label{i.-5-points-for-each-data-set-s1-and-s2-compute-support-confidence-and-lift-for-the-following-rules}

all transactions: 900 + 100 + 100 + 900 = 2,000 s(m) = (900 + 100)/2000
= 0.5 s(c) = (900 + 100)/2000 = 0.5 s(m âˆ© c) = 900/2000 = 0.45

m â†’ c confidence = s(m âˆ© c) / s(m) = 0.45/0.5 = 0.9

lift 0.45 / (0.5 * 0.5) = 1.8

c â†’ m confidence 0.45 / 0.5 = 0.9 lift = 1.8

\subsubsection{ii. (5 points) Is lift a good correlation measure here?
Why or why not? (Give one-line brief
reasoning)}\label{ii.-5-points-is-lift-a-good-correlation-measure-here-why-or-why-not-give-one-line-brief-reasoning}

we've got some problems specifically in S2 where there are too many null
transactions, this is a key indicator that the correlation is probably
distorted, so we'd need something a bit better to capture the
relationships in this datasets.

\subsubsection{(b) (5 points) The definitions of two measures on
frequent patterns, lift and cosine, look rather similar as shown
below,}\label{b-5-points-the-definitions-of-two-measures-on-frequent-patterns-lift-and-cosine-look-rather-similar-as-shown-below}

lift(A, B) = s(A âˆª B) / s(A) Ã— s(B) cosine(A, B) = s(A âˆª B) . sqrt(s(A)
Ã— s(B))

\subsubsection{where s(A) is the relative support of itemset A. Explain
why one of these two measures is nullinvariant but the other is
not.}\label{where-sa-is-the-relative-support-of-itemset-a.-explain-why-one-of-these-two-measures-is-nullinvariant-but-the-other-is-not.}

for lift, the denominator shrinks when there are a lot of null
invariants, this will make lift look a lot bigger than the true
relationship

cosine similarity isn't distorted by nulls, its bounded by 1, like a
normal dot product, so it will capture the relationship regardless of
nulls

\subsubsection{(c) (5 points) We have learned at least three correlation
measures: (1) lift, (2) Ï‡ 2 , and (3) Kulczynski. Give one example for
Kulczynski measure that it is the most appropriate measure among the
three and explain
why.}\label{c-5-points-we-have-learned-at-least-three-correlation-measures-1-lift-2-ux3c7-2-and-3-kulczynski.-give-one-example-for-kulczynski-measure-that-it-is-the-most-appropriate-measure-among-the-three-and-explain-why.}

kulc is a better measure thank lift or chi-squared in a dataset that
contains an extremly high number of null transactions. kulc is null
invariant, while lift and x\^{}2 are not, and may become inflated.

\subsubsection{(d) (5 points) Explain: If null transactions are
predominant in large datasets, Kulczynski and Imbalance Ratio are
usually used together to measure the interestingness of a
pattern.}\label{d-5-points-explain-if-null-transactions-are-predominant-in-large-datasets-kulczynski-and-imbalance-ratio-are-usually-used-together-to-measure-the-interestingness-of-a-pattern.}

kulc does a good job at finding out the direction of relationship
between two items, but not the magnitude imbalance ratio comes in to
fill in the issues kulc has with finding out if the connection is
trustworthy.
